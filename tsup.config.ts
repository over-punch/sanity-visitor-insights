/**
 * tsup build config — two entries that must never merge.
 *
 * `index` is the Studio plugin and runs in the browser. `server` is the API-route handler factory
 * and runs in Node, holding the GA4 service account and Vercel token. Keeping them as separate
 * entries with separate export subpaths is what guarantees a credential-bearing dependency can
 * never be pulled into a Studio bundle by a bundler that fails to tree-shake node-only code.
