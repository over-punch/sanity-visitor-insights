/**
 * Measurement Health — "what are we missing?", answered honestly.
 *
 * This panel began life as a "coverage gap" that subtracted Vercel pageviews from GA4 sessions and
 * attributed the difference to consent, ad-blockers and bots. That is not a valid subtraction:
 * sessions and pageviews are different units, so the difference is dominated by the unit mismatch
 * rather than by anything missing. Worse, GA4 exposes no signal that separates consent-denied from
 * blocked from bot traffic, so the attribution would have been a guess rendered with the authority
 * of a measurement.
 *
 * What this reports instead:
 *   - GA4 pageviews against Vercel pageviews, the same unit on both sides
 *   - GA4 sessions and orders alongside as context, never subtracted
 *   - one residual, labelled unexplained, with the causes we can actually measure broken out
 *
 * The only cause we can measure is consent: a `consent_granted` event makes the acceptance rate a
 * real number rather than an inference. Until that event is instrumented, the residual stays whole
 * and the panel says why.
