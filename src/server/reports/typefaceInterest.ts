/**
 * Typeface interest — viewed, tested, bought, per family.
 *
 * This is the one panel GA4's own UI cannot produce, because it joins GA4 engagement to Sanity
 * order documents. It is also the panel most easily misread, so two things are stated in the
 * response rather than left to the reader:
 *
 *   1. It measures aggregate interest per family, not one person's journey. In foundry sales the
 *      designer who tests a typeface is frequently not the person who later pays for it, and the
 *      gap between the two can be months. A low tested-to-bought ratio is therefore not a broken
 *      funnel, and the UI must not frame it as one.
 *   2. "Tested" counts only genuine engagement — a `tester_engaged` event fired when the visitor
 *      changed something. Firing on tester open would count every default-state page load as a
 *      test and make the ratio meaningless.
