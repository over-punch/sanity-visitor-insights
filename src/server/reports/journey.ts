/**
 * Journey — how far visitors get, and where they stop.
 *
 * This is an ordered step funnel, not a path graph, and that is a deliberate limit rather than a
 * simplification. GA4's Data API has no path-exploration endpoint; Path Exploration is a UI-only
 * feature. What is available is per-event totals and `runFunnelReport`, an alpha surface that
 * returns step-conversion marginals — not observed sequences. Rendering ribbons from marginals
 * would assert that a given visitor went A to B to C when no such co-occurrence was ever measured.
 *
 * So each step is reported as its own honest total, adjacent drop-off is derived between steps, and
 * the response is explicitly flagged as an approximation for the UI to display.
 *
 * A step whose event is not instrumented on this site reports as unavailable, never as zero. On a
 * site missing `begin_checkout`, the cart-to-checkout drop-off is not "100% drop-off" — it is
 * unmeasured, and the two must not look alike.
